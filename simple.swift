//This is the simplest swift program I could make.
//It doesn't use sleep because to call the external operation
// of sleep, I would need to make a file for it to output to.
//Making a file will cause slower execution and give us a less
//  accurate overhead.

//In the few runs I did with this using the time operation. I
//  found it averaged an overhead of 1.8 seconds
